excerpt: 'Potent, novel, and selective inhibitors of USP7 have been developed using both rational and structure-guided design enabled by high-resolution cocrystallography. Initial hits were identified via fragment-based screening, scaffold-hopping, and hybridization exercises. Two distinct subseries are described along with associated structure-activity relationship trends, as are initial efforts aimed at developing compounds suitable for in vivo experiments.'
