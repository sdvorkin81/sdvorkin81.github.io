excerpt: 'The main challenge in DNA quadruplex design is to encode a three-dimensional structure into the primary sequence, despite its multiple, repetitive guanine segments. We identify and detail structural elements describing all 14 feasible canonical quadruplex scaffolds and demonstrate their use in control of design. This work outlines a new roadmap for implementation of targeted design of quadruplexes for material, biotechnological, and therapeutic applications.'
