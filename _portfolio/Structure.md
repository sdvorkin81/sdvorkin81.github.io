Atomic detail structure determination in physiologically relevant solution is a key piece of information for any drug discovery campaign. Resolution for fully determined strutures is typically in the order of 3-5 Angstroms, depending on quality of data. 
Alternatively, specific biophysical properties or structural components can be characterized if full structure determination is not required.
