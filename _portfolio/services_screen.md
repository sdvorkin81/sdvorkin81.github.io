Fragment Screening by NMR is used to identify small molecules (typically 300 - 500 Daltons) with weak binding to target. After identifying hits, fragments can be grown, merged or otherwise modified to increase affinity. Fragment screening methods have resulted in four approved drugs on the market: Erdafitinib (Astex/J&J), Pexidartinib & Vemurafenib (Plexxicon), and Venetoclax (Abbievie/Genentech), and 40+ compounds across phase I, II, and III clinical trials. While X-Ray crystallography is the most commonly used fragment screening method used, many targets are not amenable to crystalization, or co-crystals with ligand are unachievable. As the comparatively 'easy' targets accessibly to crystallography become depleted, the utility of solution NMR becomes apparent.
